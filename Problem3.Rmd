Problem 3: True/False Evaluation
A. True.
ZIP codes with higher minority percentages have way more FAIR policies per 100 housing units (model A's minority coefficient is like 0.014, p < 0.001), which basically means they're definitely related in a positive way.
B. False.
There's no real evidence that minority percentage and housing age work together to affect FAIR policies—model B shows a pretty weak relationship that isn't significant (age → minority p ≈ 0.125), and when I ran a policies ~ minority*age model, the interaction term was basically zero.
C. False.
The relationship between minority percentage and policies doesn't really change based on fire risk. In model C, the minority interaction is pretty much zero (p = 0.839), so high-risk and low-risk ZIP codes have basically the same slope.
D. False.
When I added income to the simple policies ~ minority regression (model D2), the minority effect didn't go away—minority was still significant (p ≈ 0.002), so income by itself doesn't explain why there's an association.
E. True.
Even after I controlled for income, fire risk, AND housing age all at once (model E), minority percentage still had a positive, significant coefficient (about 0.008, p = 0.006).
